In this analysis, several data preprocessing and enrichment steps were performed to prepare the dataset for further exploration and modeling. The missing values across multiple columns such as NH4, SO4, and CL were identified for possible imputation or removal. The 'date' column, initially in string format, was converted to datetime format to enable time-based analysis. Following this, new features—'year' and 'month'—were extracted from the date to facilitate temporal trend analysis. Additionally, the dataset was sorted based on the observation station ID (id) and the date to ensure proper chronological order, which is essential for time series analysis. These steps significantly improved the structure and usability of the dataset.
